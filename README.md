# Todo

This project is a simple and functional To-Do List application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, React js and Redux Toolkit. The application allows users to manage their tasks effectively by adding, updating, and removing to-dos.

Features:

1. Add New Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to the to-do list using an input field and a submission button. The task will be added to the list with a unique ID generated by Redux Toolkit's nanoid.

2. Update Existing Tasks: Users can update the text of existing tasks by clicking an "Update Todo" button, which transforms the task into an editable text field. After making changes, they can save the updates.

3. Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which visually strikes through the text, helping them keep track of their progress.

4. Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list entirely using a delete button, helping them manage their to-dos effectively.

Technology Stack:

1. HTML: The structure of the components is built using JSX, which is essentially HTML integrated within JavaScript through React.

2. Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components, providing a modern and responsive design with utility-first classes.

3. JavaScript: JavaScript powers the application logic, including handling state management with Redux Toolkit, managing user interactions, and ensuring the functionality of the to-do list.

4. React js: React js is used component-based structure, allowing for reusable UI elements.

5. Redux Toolkit: Redux Toolkit is utilized for state management, providing a simple and efficient way to handle global state within the application.
